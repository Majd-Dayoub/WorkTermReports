          For my second co-op work term, I continued working at Mitsubishi Canada Aerospace, a tier 3 aerospace manufacturing company specializing in assembling the wings and center fuselages of private jets for Bombardier.
          <br>
          <br>
          At Mitsubishi, I worked within their ERP system, which was responsible for tracking and maintaining the production and scheduling processes that kept the manufacturing operations running smoothly and efficiently.

By participating in planning sessions and analyzing previous decisions, I learned to step back and evaluate situations with a broader perspective. One particular instance stands out: I suggested an alternative approach to a process that ultimately saved the team time and reduced resource waste. The positive feedback from my supervisor validated my efforts and showed me that structured problem-solving is as much about preparation as it is about execution. This journey has deepened my confidence in my ability to make impactful decisions.</p>

                  <p>Overall, my second co-op term was an incredibly valuable experience that allowed me to grow both professionally and technically. Leading a project to develop a device management system using C#, Blazor, and Bootstrap gave me hands-on experience with full-stack development and deepened my understanding of how to create scalable, efficient solutions. Working on both the backend and frontend, as well as designing the database, taught me how different components of a system come together to address real business needs.</p>

                  <p>Beyond technical skills, I gained valuable insight into working with clients and managing expectations. Collaborating with the IT department to gather requirements and training them on the system emphasized the importance of communication and adaptability. This experience reinforced how crucial it is to not only build a functional product but also ensure it meets the needs of the people using it.</p>

                  <p>Reflecting on my time in this role, I’m proud of what I accomplished and grateful for the lessons I learned. From improving my coding abilities to gaining confidence in project ownership, this co-op has equipped me with skills and experiences that will be invaluable in my future career. It has solidified my passion for problem-solving through technology and has motivated me to continue building on these foundations in the years to come.</p>
