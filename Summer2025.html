          For my third co-op work term, I joined Purolator Inc., a leading Canadian logistics and courier company specializing in transportation, supply chain, and parcel delivery services.
          <br>
          <br>
          At Purolator, I worked as a Business Data Analyst, where I developed interactive Power BI dashboards to provide actionable insights for business stakeholders and wrote Python scripts to automate manual reporting processes. This work streamlined data workflows, reduced reporting time, and improved the accuracy of recurring operational reports.

                <p>When I started this co-op term, I wanted to gain hands-on experience with Power BI and Python automation in a real-world business setting. I achieved this by building data models, designing reports, and writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks. These projects showed me how data analytics can directly improve operational efficiency.</p>
                <p>I specifically focused on learning Power BI data modeling and libraries like Playwright and pandas because they are widely used in analytics and automation. Strengthening these skills gave me a strong foundation for delivering both insights and process improvements.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. I now feel much more confident in creating scalable dashboards, automating workflows, and communicating results effectively. If there’s one area I could improve, it would be asking for feedback more often, as it could have helped me refine my solutions faster.</p>
