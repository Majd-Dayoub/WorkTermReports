          For my third co-op work term, I joined Purolator Inc., a leading Canadian logistics and courier company specializing in transportation, supply chain, and parcel delivery services.
          <br>
          <br>
          At Purolator, I worked as a Business Data Analyst, where I developed interactive Power BI dashboards to provide actionable insights for business stakeholders and wrote Python scripts to automate manual reporting processes. This work streamlined data workflows, reduced reporting time, and improved the accuracy of recurring operational reports.

                    <p>When I started, I wanted to learn more about the software development lifecycle and build practical skills in C#, SQL, CSS, and HTML. I feel like I achieved this by working within the company’s tech stack—writing SQL scripts, creating visual components, and coding unit tests with C#. These hands-on tasks gave me a much better understanding of how each piece fits into the bigger picture of software development. I’m at the beginning of my journey, and these skills will definitely help me in future roles, especially when it comes to problem-solving and understanding the flow of a project from start to finish.</p>
                    <p>I specifically wanted to work with C#, SQL, and web technologies like HTML and CSS because I knew they were foundational to a lot of modern software development. These technologies are widely used and versatile, and I figured that gaining experience with them would set a strong base for future opportunities. Working with them not only helped me strengthen my coding abilities but also gave me more confidence in understanding how back-end and front-end components interact.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, I’m happy to say that I met most of my goals. I gained practical experience with the technologies I set out to learn, and I feel more comfortable working through the different stages of the development lifecycle. That said, one area I feel I could have improved on is asking more questions. There were times when I hesitated to reach out for help or clarification, and in hindsight, that could have sped up my learning.</p>
